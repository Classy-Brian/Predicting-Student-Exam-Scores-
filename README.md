# Predicting Student Exam Scores with Linear Regression

## Project Overview

This project uses machine learning, specifically linear regression, to predict a student's math exam score based on various factors, including study habits, demographics, and school-related information. The goal is to identify the key factors that influence academic performance and build a model that can accurately predict student scores. This project could potentially be used to identify students at risk and tailor educational interventions.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the "Expanded data with more features" dataset, which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/desalegngeb/students-exam-scores).

The dataset contains information on 30,641 students and includes the following categories of features:

*   **Demographics:** Gender, Ethnicity, Parent Education Level, Parent Marital Status
*   **Study Habits:** Weekly Study Hours
*   **School-Related:** Lunch Type, Test Preparation Course
*   **Other:** Number of Siblings, Sports Participation, First Child Status, Transportation Method
*   **Target Variable:** Math Score (0-100)
